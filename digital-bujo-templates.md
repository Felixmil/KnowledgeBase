## Defining Templates

As I want to try digital bullet journaling and that bullet journaling rely on adopting a constant format, template will be a good way to reach this goal.

### Daily log

What is good for a daily template ?

- Date for references
- Tags for navigating subjects
- How I feel section for expressing myself
- Todos for following tasks and completions
- Events for keeping track of things
- Notes for quick thought or new element on a subject

as per https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn, todos, events and notes can be mixed and nested for convenience. This would lead in a simple X section template:

- Date (title)
- tags
- How I feel section
- Free writing for bullets

I notice I like to keep things organized by topic, just like this current note, it has separate sections aka "collections" in the BuJo paradigm.

Maybe these collections should be in separated files for easy future access and modifications. Thanks to foam ecosystem, this is would be possible. for exemple

# Digital Bujo Keys

#journaling #bujo

This document aims to settle the key code I will be using for my digital bullet journaling.

## Tasks

The basis of a task is a `[ ]`. Characters inside of the brackets defines the state of the task:

- `[ ]` Todo
- `[x]` Done
- `[/]` in progress
- `[-]` Canceled
- `[>]` migrated to another day
- `[<]` Done on a previous day
- `[o]` waiting for something to be done

## Notes

Quicknotes are just text preceded by `-`:

- this is a quicknote

More complete notes should be new files (or adding to existing ones):

- [[example note on a subject]]

## Events

Events are noted with a ğŸ“… emoji
